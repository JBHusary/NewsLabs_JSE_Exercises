 To carry out the given assessment for BBC NewsLabs, I opted to complete exercises that on the one hand would require I make use of various python functions and on the other, are what I might do in my day to day at NewsLabs to benefit BBC NewsLabs. I chose Exercise C to find the hours with the highest mean for each region; and Exercise E to find the hours in which the hourly mean on a mobile phone is greater than the overall mean.

 As my preferred programming language, I opted to use python3 and imported pandas and numpy libraries to streamline the analyses. For each exercise, my first step was to create a new dataframe with the hourly means. I changed the 'Date' column to the datetime datatype using pandas .to_datetime and reset it to be the index.  I then created a new dataframe with hourly means, using pandas groupby function to convert each fifteen minutes to their hourly .ceil.  This was preferred than using the .floor because the values listed at each fifteen minute interval represent totals for the previous fifteen minutes, and accurate hourly results are only achievable by with values that start and end at H:15 and H+1:00, respectively.  This unfortunately, mislabeled the corresponding hour to hourly mean by +1 hours.  To fix this, I used the shift function to shift the data by -1 hour.  I also opted to create a dataframe along each step of the process to better enable cross-checking for accurate data using the print statement; and to also enable other and large scale analysis with any of the resulting dataframes, that may be useful for helping NewsLabs make decisions about when and where and on which type to  distribute News content online.
